# Flutter tutorials

This repo is intended to hold every tutorial project that I do with flutter.

I chose to use a monorepo, regardless of whether there are shared codes or not, 
to learn how to manage multiple project with Melos. But also to get an idea of 
how to work in a monorepo environement.
